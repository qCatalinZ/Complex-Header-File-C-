# Complex-Header-File-C++-
Implementation of complex numbers in C++ using classes and Header File.
I made my own implementation for complex numbers with aditional functions and operations.
I also used cmath and iostream for my implementations, cmath is used for functions like atan(), sqrt() and the number M_PI
and iostream is used for operator>> and operator<<
